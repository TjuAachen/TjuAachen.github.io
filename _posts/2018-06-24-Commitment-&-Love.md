Today is June 24th 2018 and 1 complete month since my first post. Up to now, sadly, I made no obvious breakthrough on my research. What's worse, 
My patience is wearing thin and I am gradually losing the passion and trust on my work.

But, in fact, I don't accumulate sufficient knowledge in this specialist field. Part of my judgments can be very superficial and erroneous. That's
the reason why I am still optimistic about it and have confidence in it without any solid reasons.

In the future, I will be  more concentrated on my research and fill in the knowledge gap by editing one book.

At this moment, you have no other choice and have to advance forward like a solider. Good luck, man! Never ever give up!
