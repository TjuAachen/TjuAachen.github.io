Time flies. Four days have passed since the last post. In these four days, I posted my second thread on zhihu website, Chinese answer to Quora, and created a campus-wide sensation with no surprise. My answer got 115 thumb-ups right now and the thread was viewed by 50 thousands people. I am a little bit proud of it. But at the same time, it motivates me to absord more knowledge to output more content of high quality.

With the respect to my research, I analyzed the kinetic data of HDN reaction and figured out a pattern underbeneath the seemingly disordered data. In spite of this finding, some knowledge gaps such as the details about HDN reaction network still need filling by reading some relevant references. Now I am doing these works and stressed because the deadline(June 15th) is approaching. 

That's the reason why I named this thread as "keep a cool head". Although time budget is limited and the future is not clear, I have to persevere with this process since I can almost see the light at the end of tunnel. 

The current biggest problem is my attention is easily distracted by other things. In the following days, I will try my best to get rid of this bad habit. 

Keep a cool head and never ever give up! the dawn is breaking.
