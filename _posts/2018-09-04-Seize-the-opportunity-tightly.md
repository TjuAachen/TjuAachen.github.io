Today is in the early septemper. I have an impulse to write something down and also to keep updating this blog frequently. Recently, despite 
the ray of hope in my simulation work, the future is still unclear. It's uncertain whether the model is appropriate to all the experimental results.
This really makes me jittery.

What's worse, I am left behind by my peers. Most of them have already finished their experimental tasks and submitted their manuscripts to journals.
Some of them even have published their first paper. But, for me, I have no publication right now! I am a little bit anxious and start to introspect
my choice. 

"Am I wrong?" I ask myself in mind. No, I am right. The thing I am doing is really my favorite as I can free my imagination to formulate models and
most importantly, I could integrate math with chemical engineering.

Then now that you enjoy your research, what are you worried about? I inquire myself again. 

It is the vanity to blame. This answer occurs to me.

Yes, that's true. In your previous life experience, you always compete with peers under the same standard. You run with them in the same lap. You take the same exams.
But now things are different.  And you still persist with the past and the seemingly common standard. That is the source of unnecessary pain and worry.

The standard is diverse. Even if the graduation was delaid, you can live a full life as well. So you shall not wallow in the self-pity.
Quite the opposite, you should seize this invaluable opportunity tightly and never let it slip away. Other students' life are irrelevant to you.
What you should do is just to live under this moment and enjoy it.

I hope in the next thread, there are some good news about your research. Risk also bring us opprtunities. Never ever give up! Cheer up, Aachen!
