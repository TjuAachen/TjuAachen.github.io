This is the first thread in June. It is sad to see that many classmates have submitted their manuscripts for review, but no breakthrough is made by me recently. 

In my mind, it was unfair. Since in terms of amount of work and difficulties, my research is uncomparable. How could I be left behind by the other
students given that I am so hard working and ternacious?

But when I calmed down and resumed my composure later, I found it was justified. Because my research demands more hard work and is far more difficult 
than my classmates' as evidenced by the 0.7 million funding brought by it. I should not suffer a tunnel vision and instead ought to be farsighted.

They will be attacked by the reality of the ruthless job market soon because of their early summission to the difficulty. It is just a matter of time
for them to know graduation within due time can bring them nothing but a proof of their mediocrity.On the other hand, I will gain the final victory through my relentless efforts to pursue superiority. 

In the coming days, I am going to figure out the main factors and their interactions in my research. Based on this, I will embrace the coming dawn and be rewarded with a joy of discovery.

Finally, I would like to end this thread with a excerpt from selection work of chairman mao:
But when I say that there will soon be a high tide of revolution in China, I am emphatically not speaking of something which in the words of some people "is possibly coming", something illusory, unattainable and devoid of significance for action. 

It is like a ship far out at sea whose mast-head can already be seen from the shore; 

It is like the morning sun in the east whose shimmering rays are visible from a high mountain top; 

It is like a child about to be born moving restlessly in its mother's womb.
