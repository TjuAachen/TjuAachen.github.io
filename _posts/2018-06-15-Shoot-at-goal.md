It is in the middle of June. I just finished revising the progress report at noon. When I reviewed it, one of the comments left by professor
Xin embrassed me:"You have not shot at the goal even after the world cup has already kicked off." In a humourous and metorphorical way, professor 
complained to me of my slow progress. I felt guilty at first but then this sense diminished gradually.Perhaps it implied that I can consider other people's comments with sanity now and take a critical attitude to them.

To ease the tension, I immersed into the world of literature and enjoyed the joy of reading tonight. I were aware clearly that I ought to make a concrete plan and 
implement it to shoot at goal as soon as possible.Nevertheless, I still procrastinated and had no plan to achieve my goal.Luckily, I kept using my subconscious to contemplate on my research at the same time, which can give some solace to my guily heart.

In the morning, I will conceive a concrete plan to prepare my graduate school application, research and life.

Last, I hope in the near future, I could shoot at the goal magnificiently as the first-rate football player does.

Cheer on, Aachen! The light at the end of tunnel is within the sight!
