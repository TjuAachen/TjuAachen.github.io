Today is July 13rd. 2 months have gone away since the last thread. In these 2 month, I made a small breakthrough in the kinetic modeling of
hydronitrogenation process. And the whole picutre of Albermale-company-reported-hydrodesulfurization-process was discovered by me in a trade magazine. The last thing is just to find or formulate an equation fitting the reported pattern. In this sense, the final destination 
is approached.

In the following days, I will initiate my graduate school application process, which, in my eyes, is a little bit troublesome. Time consuming
and complicated as it is, I will do it.

At the very last, as usual, I would like to advice you keeping a cool head and still working hard. All efforts will be paid off!!! Keep it in
your mind.
