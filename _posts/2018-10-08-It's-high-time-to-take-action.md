Long National leave has just passed. Time flees so fast that I almost lose track of it. Up to now, sadly, I am still stuck in this problem. But, as
usual, I never ever give up and always believe when there is a will, there is a way. The problem can be solved if it is solved in a right fashion.

Despite the slow progress on my research, what concern me most now is my timidity. Gripped by this emotion, I connceived many execuses to defer action though I have planned
it thousand times in my mind. In my research, fear of failure deters me from concentrating my mind on formulating new models to fit data. In my application process, worry
about being rejected threats me from starting. And the results will be exaberated by the leaving of time and opprtunities.

Then what should I do to overcome it? The antidote is Taking Action Right now.

Whenever you feel intimidated, just take action and this emotion will be forgotten right away. Whenever you are afraid of being rejected, just have a try since
you can never know the final result except you try it. 

But before you take action, keep it in your mind that you should be fully prepared both in thinking and other conditions. 

So kick off change at this moment! Prepare all the materials for application process; Bravely email to your potential supervisors; Commit your heart and soul to
interpret data and decipher the kinetic complexity. 

Cheer up, Aachen!!
