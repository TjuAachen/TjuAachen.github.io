Hello world! It almost takes me 40 minutes to configure my blog site hosted by github. But it is worth the time and efforts since now I can express myself freely in this virtual space.

In the following days, I will record my master degree pursuing process by writing here so that I can finish the task of writing daily to make it. And I hope you enjoy it. 

Last words for you, Aachen:  **Never ever give up!**
